# File Handling of 5' UTR of Homo sapiens Using Python

In this task, we will explore how to handle file operations in Python to manage the 5' Untranslated Region (UTR) sequences of Homo sapiens. The goal is to read, process, and write these sequences efficiently, allowing for further analysis or storage.

## Description
The provided Python code is structured to handle the file operations related to the 5' UTR sequences of Homo sapiens. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each component:

Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing the os library, which is useful for interacting with the operating system, although it is not explicitly used in this snippet.

Reading UTR Sequences: The read_utr_file function takes a file path as an argument and attempts to read the contents of the specified file. It handles potential errors, such as the file not being found, and returns a list of UTR sequences, ensuring that any empty lines are excluded.

Processing Sequences: The process_utr_sequences function processes the list of UTR sequences. In this example, it converts each sequence to uppercase, but this function can be modified to include more complex processing as needed.

Writing Processed Sequences: The write_processed_sequences function takes the processed sequences and writes them to a new file. Each sequence is written on a new line, and a confirmation message is printed upon successful completion.

Main Function: The main function orchestrates the workflow. It defines the input and output file paths, calls the reading function, processes the sequences, and finally writes the results to the output file.

Execution: The script is designed to run as a standalone program, executing the main function when the script is run directly.

This code serves as a foundational template for handling biological sequence data, and it can be expanded with additional features such as error handling, data validation, or more complex processing algorithms as required by specific research needs.
